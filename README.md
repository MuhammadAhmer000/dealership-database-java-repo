# Motor Vehicle Dealership Database System

## Overview
This is a university project demonstrating a small-scale database system with a Java GUI front end. 
It manages stock, sales, and customer interactions for a motor vehicle dealership. The project covers:
- Database design with Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) modeling
- Database schema creation and constraints
- Java GUI implementation for CRUD operations

## Project Structure
- `docs/` → Written report including ER diagram, database schema, keys, and constraints
- `src/` → Java source code for GUI and database logic

## Features
- Add, update, delete, and query vehicles, sales, employees, and customers
- Supports multiple users (Administrator and Normal Users)
- Basic input validation for data integrity
- Queries using joins and aggregate functions

## How to Run
1. Import the `src/MotorVehicleGUI` folder into your IDE (NetBeans/Eclipse).  
2. Ensure Oracle Database and JDBC driver are set up correctly.  
3. Run `Main.java` to launch the application. The database tables are expected to already exist.
